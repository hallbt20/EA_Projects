Hope all is well!  All is good on my end as I have been keeping busy evaluating new opportunities. With that said, I am getting close on one that would be considered a start-up but they have about $70M of annual sales. It is a PE-sponsored ""roll-up"" that they are putting together and now they need a ""finance org"".

I am evaluating the CFO role and it is clear they need a Controllership function to be put in place ASAP to stand up this business. I wanted to reach out to see if you could put me in contact with the practice leader to learn more about your outsourced Controllership/Accounting solutions. Note this is a med device company.

Thanks again and look forward to catching up at one of the next CFO Intelligence events.

Please help schedule that for once Ryan is back and please add me also.

 

Sean also has a very interesting pet related startup and can’t find a banking solution that will provide what he needs.  Here are the details.

 

Cotl Banking Needs

Cotl (pronounced like ""coddle"") empowers pet owners to love, support, and care for their current and future pets even if the owner becomes sick, injured, or hospitalized or passes away. Pet owners document care arrangements with caretakers and set aside funds to support their pet's ongoing care. Cotl helps caretakers quickly access pets (and funds to care for them) when the time comes so pets experience minimal disruption. 

 

At its core, Cotl is streamlining the creation of pet trusts and the formation of a trust fund used to care for pets. My law firm will serve as trustee of these Cotl plans to provide third-party oversight and accountability over caretaker's use of funds.

 

Pet trusts generally involve smaller sums than comprehensive trusts. So, ideally, I'd like to establish a consolidated trust account in which Valle Legal can hold trust funds from all Cotl plans. This would allow us to more easily manage funds, reduce account fees and expenses, and quickly satisfy balance thresholds for accounts with better interest and investment opportunities. Alternatively, we would consider establishing individual accounts for each pet trust if we found a banking partner that could expedite that process with minimal account fees.

 

I'd appreciate any introductions to innovative banking partners who can address these considerations.","Valle Legal","Chelsea Martin","0.1","Partnerships","New Business","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","false","0.0","false","1.0","","2024-04-09 12:13","Offline Sources","CRM_UI","userId:27309896","2024-04-03 13:35","","","","","1.0","0.0","","EAOS Sales Pipeline","","","CRM UI","","","","","","Accounting","Startup","","EA- Brooks Malone","","","","Chelsea Martin","","",""

SBST is the owner of the MacroFactor app, a premium nutrition and food logging app. It is a bootstrapped company without any outside funding. All of SBST's revenue is generated by the MacroFactor app.

We have five member-managers, three employees (currently in the process of bringing on a few more), and several contractors. Currently, our bookkeeping is done by Merritt Bookkeeping;our taxes are done by Cherry Bekaert;we manage HR and payroll in Gusto;and we use Carta for things like valuations and an employee profits interest program.

However, as our company's size and complexity has continued to grow, we've realized the need for a more centralized, supportive, and proactive partner for evolving our financial, tax, and HR management.

We're hoping this is where you can come in!

We are looking for a firm that can help us with things like: taking over Gusto administration of payroll and compliance, administering our profits interest program and handling annual valuations in Carta, monthly bookkeeping, providing financial reports and projections, handling all aspects of our taxes and compliance, and handling HR tasks such as keeping our handbook up to date and administering our 401k program.

We'd love to talk with you and learn more about the services you offer and if we'd be a good fit for each other. Thank you!","Stronger By Science Technologies LLC (SBST).

I have a prospective client that would like a proposal for services including outsourced accounting/bookkeeping/CFO.

 

They are a foreign owned corporation which will be selling blood testing kits as well as setting up a lab to analyze said kits. 

 

They will have a limited back office in the US which is where we come in.  They are already using Microsoft Business Center for their Swedish company and would like to use the same for the US company.

 

Preliminarily, they would like someone to do everything for them in the US including invoicing, bill pay, sales tax returns, benefits, insurances, etc.  They will also need tax return prep and nexus work which we can handle.","Capitainer, Inc","Chelsea Martin","0.0","Dead Leads Inquiries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","false","0.0","true","0.0","2024-01-04 11:22","2024-01-04 11:23","Offline Sources","CRM_UI","userId:27309896","2024-01-03 20:22","","","","","1.0","0.0","4.0","Lost Deals","","","CRM UI","","","","","","?Unknown?","Startup","","EA- James Knight Sr &  Michael Hal","","","","Chelsea Martin","","",""

 The company structure is that the parent company is incorporated in Delaware and then there is a UK subsidiary.

I am starting an Insurance Agency and am in need of a CPA firm with experience in this field whom I can grow with.  Would this be something that you/your firm could advise/service?

 A little about my goals and objectives.  P&C sector focused on commercial business i.e.;  shopping strips, multifamily, hotels, condo buildings, apartment complexes, some retail, and potentially cyber security.  There may be some cross-over into home and auto, coming in the form of an added service to high-net-worth individuals whom I would be servicing commercial insurance for.  

 Growth plan:  By the 3-year mark, I would be looking to bring in a partner to operate the Atlanta office as I focus on growing new markets.  For growth in new markets, I would require a similar partnership model as the Atlanta office.  By the 4-year mark I would like to add a new sector in Life Insurance (I am aware of additional licensing requirements) following a similar growth model as the P&C sector.  By the 5-year mark I will be looking to purchase established books.  There are other sectors I am interested in growing into by the 10-year mark however those goals are fluid and will take shape as I secure the trajectory of the two aforementioned sectors in my 4-year plan. 

I have sought advice from folks within my network and am leaning toward a holding company-subsidiary model to facilitate future growth and compartmentalize liabilities that may arise, however, am open to going a different route. 
My needs:  Corporate structure and filings.  Ongoing bookkeeping and professional tax and business financial best practices.  Note I will be starting my firm as an individual.
If this is something in your wheelhouse I would love to discuss service and fees.  Thank you for your time, looking forward to hearing back from you.

SRNK is a group I have been talking to for some time now and Lourenco Miranda has been instrumental in getting them plugged into some banks to help get their project (as described in the attached) up and running.  They texted me (yes already on those terms) today and asked that I help get the right people to connected to propose on Outsourced CFO and Accounting services.  Based on the description, is this something you would be interested in working on?

Day to day - entering AP, responding to vendor inquiries
current ap volume is approximately 10-20 a week 
weekly review of Divvy transactions - making sure they are coded within Divvy and that all receipts are collected and attached.
weekly transaction coding for 3 bank accounts (again, minimal as 98% of everything is going through divvy and bill.com.  So far this week we've had 4 transactions - 3 of which were bill.com). Transaction count will be increasing - but it all will run through Divvy and bill.com
Assistance creating PO's as needed (basic data entry - only used for vendors that require a physical PO - we do not account for PO's - it is a basic template in Excel)
Possibly help with weekly cash burn report
Month end - full close - reconciling bank/balance sheet accounts, etc.
simple, standard close - i have not changed anything so the same set up as other clients.  There is no revenue.  We are heading into our clinical trial - so things from a coding perspective are about to get much more complicated (applies to AP entry as well)
Ideally a controller to review the month end close - not necessary at the time being if you are short staffed
Volume is small enough right now I can keep doing this part - but if possible would like to get it off my plate to help get a controller in and familiar before things start going crazy
Systems we are using: QBO, Bill.com, Divvy, Gusto, Asana, Slack
Not planning to transition payroll over at this time
Have an established accounting@ email that will be used for both internal and external communications","Aqutal","Chelsea Martin","1.0","Active Client","New Business","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","true","1.0","true","0.0","2023-05-05 15:55","2023-08-07 11:59","Offline Sources","CRM_UI","userId:27309896","2023-05-05 15:50","","","","","1.0","0.0","3.0","Startup Clients","","","CRM UI","","","","","","Accounting","Startup","","Stephanie Mc Murray","","","","Chelsea Martin","","",""

I was wondering if you could share with me the Eisner outsourced CFO / Controller contact information to pass along to my girlfriend who’s got the medical device start-up, MyEyes LLC.  She really needs the help as things are ramping up for them.  I would love to help her, but I think she would be better served by a dedicated outsource resource.  Any info you could share would be helpful.


Thanks,

LAGO primarily provides venture debt financing customized to meet your particular needs as you scale your business, be it working capital, asset purchases, operating expenses, acquisitions, or other strategic growth initiatives. Taking a holistic look at your business, our term loans are structured based on multiple factors relevant to your business, which often leads to structures that provide more upfront growth capital with more flexible terms than your traditional credit provider would offer. Our debt products are designed to work in concert with sponsors’ existing equity investment, at a lower cost and dilution, to prolong the period to future equity raises and debt refinancings.

My contact Greg Smith (aka Smitty) is their CFO and was the first person I ever worked for when I started work in the US in 2001.  I have worked with him at 5 separate companies, as well as at Keating where he was one of our CFOs for a while.  His request is:

'We need to engage a mid-level HR consultant for two to three months to help us with a transition from TriNet to Paylocity (both payroll transition and open enrollment as we bring benefits in house).  It might be close to full time.  I would think at least 30-35 hours per week.  Might this work and, if yes, any ballpark sense of the range of the hourly rate?'

Ryan and Bruce were thinking this could be a project we could split between the team rather than assign to one person.  What do you think?  I realized I don't have a current email address for Greg so I thought I would send the details to you first and then effect an intro, assuming we think it could work.

I’m Alek and I work on Atlas Labs’ finance team. We are a Series A healthcare technology & services start-up focused on medical financial aid. (www.atlas.health)  

 

We’re looking to mature our accounting practices.  More specifically, we are embarking on developing formal accounting policies and procedures (especially as it pertains to revenue recognition of BPO and SaaS clients) as well as completing annual audits.  

 

If you work with companies in our situation, would you be available for a 20-minute introduction call to help us evaluate fit on working together? 

 

Thank you,

"6884928524","","","","","","","","","","Lucy Pham","","","","0.0","","We're looking for an interim/fractional CFO to help with a both a short-term debt raise $8-$10MM as well as a large growth capital round of $50 - $75MM. We've spoken to Stifel, Jefferies and two other boutique advisors/banks, but need help sorting through options. We don't have a CFO currently but have BerganKDV doing operational finance for us;however, we need strategic guidance during this fundraise and someone to run it from end-to-end. Here's a bit more below about what we do.

After 11 years building a $60MM metabolic optimization company self-funded (50% YoY rev growth, 64% recurring revenue, a 200+ team), we’re now exploring doing a large (for us) fundraise, and looking to align ourselves with good people we can trust who know our space, can grok our vision, advise on capital structure/strategy, run the fundraising process and become a great long-term strategic growth partner.

We’ve quietly built an integrated ecosystem of solutions including nutrition, exercise, coaching, supplements, functional foods and premium memberships to solve for the frustratingly disconnected experience that plagues the health and wellness landscape today. This is a personal passion as I had health issues in my early 20s and found it incredibly frustrating bouncing from one doctor to another and felt like I was left twisting in the wind.

We recently purchased the Metabolic.com domain so we can officially own our positioning. We will rebrand to simply “Metabolic” in 2 months, launch our new website and app shortly thereafter, integrating into a unified UX all those solutions we’ve developed separately to date. We laser focus on metabolism simply because we’ve found that when you get that dialed in, your cells get the energy they need to do their jobs right, allowing your entire body to thrive.

We’ve substantially de-risked the business, having done $212MM in rev to date, spent $70MM in paid online acquisition, acquired 40MM leads, 1.5MM buyers and have a multi-channel (DTC, retail, practitioner, corporate, etc.) growth plan to become a multi-billion $ business by 2025.","Metabolic Living","Lucy Pham (Deactivated User)","0.0","Dead Leads Inquiries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","false","0.0","true","0.0","2021-12-02 16:16","2023-04-11 15:57","Direct Traffic","keatingconsulting.com/","","2021-11-10 06:33","","","","","1.0","0.0","3.0","Lost Deals","","","CRM UI","","","","","","","","","website","","","","Lucy Pham","","",""

It occurs to me that perhaps we could use your services as well.  We have an accountant, but frankly, we're very unhappy with him.

A bit more about our company: my wife (cc'd) and I constitute two of the three founders, but we have funded the project in its entirety until now.  We will soon be interested in the idea of raising funds. Two members of the team have experience raising funds, but we might be interested in learning about options; I have a concern that some of the ways of raising money may result in raising too much too fast or not at all.

They import products from China to the US and sell it on their website, Amazon and through retail distributors. They are using Rush Order for warehousing and Rush Order is based in California.

The company is looking for bookkeeping/accounting and finance services for their US entity and that is why I thought of you.

Below I have detailed the setup for the company. Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

AM Lab Americas will buy products straight from the Chinese manufacturing partner at cost and will sell through the various US and Canadian channels through Rush Order (3PL) and D&H (Distribution). The company  needs a turn key operation in the US that will cover legal, books, filings etc to make sure AM Denmark will only have a limited point of references to oversee this. 

The company wants to make sure that there are no issues in bringing all product lines (Get Clean, Basics, Clean Sound) into single US contracts (Rush Order / D&H) and that there’s no conflict in legal structuring that would prevent us. That way, all D&H simply runs under 1 brand (AM Lab) and all AMAZON can run under that single AM Lab sub-vendor ID at AMAZON.","AM Labs","Lucy Pham (Deactivated User)","0.0","Former Clients","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","false","0.0","true","0.0","2021-02-08 16:05","2023-04-11 15:37","Offline Sources","SALES","EMAIL_INTEGRATION","2020-08-03 14:15","","","","","2.0","0.0","39.0","Startup Clients","","","CRM UI","","","","","","","","","Munish Gupta (SC Advisory)","","","Customer - Current","Stephanie McMurray","","",""

Our team, alongside external accountants, has done a solid job maintaining our books on a modified cash basis through a series of fundraises over the past couple of years. As we enter our next phase of growth, we're looking to engage an accounting firm to work with us on three initiatives:

- Perform a diagnostic of our historical books / systems, providing a report on findings (issues, improvements, recommendations, etc.) and providing advice on several more specific items (phantom stock, founder stock, options, convertible notes, equity investments, etc.)
- Shift our system from a modified cash basis to an accrual basis
- Provide an overview of bookkeeping services offered that would maintain our books on an monthly basis as well as additional consulting services on accounting related activities (R&D credits, EOY taxes, etc)

I'd love to understand more about your firm’s expertise in the above areas to see if there is a mutual fit, incl. any info you have on both your expertise in and likely costs of these services.

"1705632643","","","","","","","","","","Lucy Pham","","","","0.0","","""Hi there-

I'm CEO at Skylight, an SF and LA based startup. We're searching for a back-office person to help us with the below. Bookkeeping and finance is actually not currently on the list (though we may expand to needing that later this year), so I'm wondering if this is something that's a fit for Keating?

1) We need someone local to SF at least once every week or two to pick up and process snail mail from states where we're registered for sales tax and other stuff

2) Insurance compliance work

3) Tax and regulatory compliance work

Eventually, the job would expand further, to various accounting and finance functions, but these are the most burning needs today.

If it's a fit, let's jump on the phone next Thurs or Fri to discuss!

Thanks so much-

"1705564341","","","","","","","","","","Lucy Pham","","","","0.0","","A little background  - this is an introduction from Ellen. It looks like Ellen has worked pretty close with Chris from MMA previously and he reached out to her on behalf of Angion. 

The company has 50-55 employees. Currently the payroll is being run by the office manager who apparently made a couple of mistakes which has led the new VP of HR to determine that they need to either hire a new resource or outsource it. 

They have employees currently in CA, Boston and NY. 

Currently on Paychex flex with time and attendance. No hourly employees and thinking that this would be about 20 hours a month or so. Could be looking for a full-time resource but looks like they want to hold off. 

I have had an initial conversation with Chris where I told him about our experience doing this for Good Data and how we may be able to help postpone the need for a full-time hire. I also told him that we have two folks (usually one from HR and another from accounting) working on this together each with their specialized knowledge. 

It looks like we would report up to the VP of HR but may want to check on this. 

They do not have a benefit admin portal set up yet as Chris from MMA just recently got the client. So we may be working pretty closely with them on finding the most efficient solution. 

Chris asked if we would be trying to bring in our own broker (Ron) and I reassured him that we play well with others and will not be doing anything of the sort. 

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks,

I'd like to introduce you to Manoj Acharya, founder / CEO of Asserts.ai, a stealth portfolio company of a16z. While the company is still in its very early phase, they are looking to bring on a strong outsourced CFO firm from the get go who can engage with them at both a strategic and tactical level. Given your team's expertise not only with working/scaling with startups, I thought your team would be a potential great fit.

Manoj - Ryan is the managing partner (and founder) at Keating Consulting. They are a full service firm (Finance, HR, etc.) that will be able to help you with your needs. You are in good hands!

Ryan, Manoj. Manoj, Ryan. I'll let you two take it from here.

Because this entity has a 100% US subsidiary, Mediagenix Corporation, we kindly ask you wether you are interested to assist us with the tax due diligence, as far as this US entity is concerned?

The scope would in principle entail the following:

- Scan of trial balances and tax declarations, for the accounting years where the relevant statute of limitations has not yet expired and a scan of the relevant VAT returns.
- A high level review of the transfer pricing policy and past legal restructurings/acquisition structures (if any).
- past tax audits (if any) and identify potential material (>€50k) issues in CTX, VAT and payroll taxes per issue per year.
- Based thereon, report on key issues and potential tax cash optimization opportunities to be covered in the vendor assistance report.
- Review of tax compliance environment of the US subsidiary (historic filing position, relationship with tax authority, any past tax audits etc.);
Based on the information we currently have, the US entity is a mere sales / rep. Office from the Belgian parent company. Given the materiality limit of 50k EUR, the scope/work for each subsidiary should be rather limited in our opinion.

We have to communicate a fee proposal today (Central Europe Time). We are aware this is at short notice. Therefore, could you please respond you fee quote upon your earliest convenience?

p.s; We listed below in bullet point the information we currently have in this respect.

I propose to have a call to discuss further in detail (if required).

Kind regards,

Philippe / Olivier

The variable on time would be the existing status of the US book management. Understanding that you have audit and year-end prep level of detail requirements, it may require the practice of 'reverse' consolidation + inter-company account reconciliation with subsidiaries - Step 2: Generate manual global consolidation report - 15 to 20 hours. the practice includes foreign currency translation on standalone book, inter-company elimination entry preparation, etc.   NetSuite data entry and migration - dual system - enter completed 2018 and 2019 subsidiary data as standalone financial results (from QBO) to NetSuite. Estimation is 30 to 60 hours; range depends on different approaches - Note that hour estimation does not include the support during NetSuite system implementation - as in running accounting in QB in parallel to in-house team learning NetSuite. This would require further details on current Moloco full cycle accounting (operation, closing, etc) workflow.   Total estimated hours as understood/scoped above - 300 to 400 hours.   This project is expected to take 8-10 weeks. This estimated time frame is dependent to some degree on having access to Company’s information as requested and team members as needed as well as Consultant’s understanding of the scope of services necessary at the time of entering into this Agreement.

 - Korea - about 150 to 200 hours for 2018 and 2019 combined - variable for estimated time is based on level of completeness for supporting documentation - how much back-up and detail is available
 - Singapore - about 40 to 60 hours for 2018 and 2019 combined
 
 Global Consolidation Preparation
 - Step 1: US standalone book inter-company transactions - estimated at 30 to 40 hours. The variable on time would be the existing status of the US book management. Understanding that you have audit and year-end prep level of detail requirements, it may require the practice of 'reverse' consolidation + inter-company account reconciliation with subsidiaries
 - Step 2: Generate manual global consolidation report - 15 to 20 hours. the practice includes foreign currency translation on standalone book, inter-company elimination entry preparation, etc. 
 
 NetSuite data entry and migration - dual system
 - enter completed 2018 and 2019 subsidiary data as standalone financial results (from QBO) to NetSuite. Estimation is 30 to 60 hours; range depends on different approaches
 - Note that hour estimation does not include the support during NetSuite system implementation - as in running accounting in QB in parallel to in-house team learning NetSuite. This would require further details on current Moloco full cycle accounting (operation, closing, etc) workflow. 
 
 Total estimated hours as understood/scoped above - 300 to 400 hours. 
 
 This project is expected to take 8-10 weeks. This estimated time frame is dependent to some degree on having access to Company’s information as requested and team members as needed as well as Consultant’s understanding of the scope of services necessary at the time of entering into this Agreement.
